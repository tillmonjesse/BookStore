# Book Store

Book Store is a test project created to learn some basic javascript with the idea of implementing these skills into more advanced projects. 

## What you can do

Book Store is an array of different fictional books that each one has title, author, a number of pages, price, and unique id. There are a few ways you interact with this in the command prompt that in include:

- **sum**: Counts all of the pages of every book .

- **average**: Gives you the average number of pages of all the books.

- **max**: Gives you the most expensive book.

- **min**: Gives you the least expensive book.

- **create**: Will create a new book in the array and add unique id to the book. The order that it must be entered in is title, author, price, pages. Once the new book is created it will reurn the new book with the added id.

- **read**: If an id is entered it return the book with that id.

- **change**: This will the user to change a property of a book. First the user must put the id of the book that they want to change, then the name of the property, followed by the new value of the propeerty.

- **remove**: Once the user enters in the id of the book it will be deleted from the array
